# Cache

Widget content is **not cached** by default. 
Caching can be enabled by checking the _Cache_ option in Extension Manager configuration.

Cache entries are identified by a hash value of the widget configuration.
The content cache is registered with the TYPO3 _pages_ and _all_ cache groups.

Thus the content cache is flushed together with the page cache.
